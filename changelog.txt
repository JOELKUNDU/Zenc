22/07/2020 -  Fixed error in making keyfiles
              Now keyfiles saved in c:\Zenc\Keys dir (on windows)
                                 in /home/user/Zenc/Keys (on linux)
              Features Still to be added:
                1. User defined output paths
                2. AES-CCM
              Bugs (Will be fixed soon):
                It tries to re-encrypt already encrypted files. (just continue when the prompt comes)
                Same with decrypting i.e will try to decrypt already decrypted files
                Will not delete orignal files on Windows
21/07/2020 -  Added following modes:
              AES-ECB
              AES-CTR
              AES-CFB
              AES-OFB
              Added feature to show time taken for the entire processs in the end.
              Features Still to be added:
                1. User defined output paths
                2. AES-CCM
20/07/2020 -  Added AES - CBC mode
              Add option to generate passwords instead of .zkey files
              fixed: zkey file being created without extension
              Features Still to be added:
                1. AES-ECB, AES-CFB,AES-OFB,AES-CTR,AES-CCM
                2. Add option for user defined output
19/07/2020 -  Completed Source Code Added
              Supported Modes (AES-GCM2k , AES-GCM64k, AES-EAX)
              Bugs removed:
                1. Not encrypting / decrypting files
                2. Not encrypting / decrypting filenames
                3. Error while encrypting / decrypting folder when the file is not encrypted before hand
              Features Planned:
                1. Add AES-CBC.
                2. Add option to have a password generated instead of a keyfile
                3. Add option to specify output path
18/07/2020 -  Added Partial Source Code and Exe
